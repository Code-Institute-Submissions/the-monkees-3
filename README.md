# The Monkees Website
This is intended as a promotional website whereby fans and potential fans can
use multimedia clips from a back catalog, and any new material as
it becomes available. As well as showcasing their music it publicises their
availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties. Visit the site at this address:

## Site Design
Pre development wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) (see [wireframes.pdf](resources/wireframes.pdf)). Website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) was used to determine a colour
scheme that uses complementary colours (see [palette.pdf](resources/palette.pdf)).

## Features
**Album time line** - designed using custom CSS to complement bootstrap CSS.

**Image Gallery** - makes use of bootstrap modals, displaying each picture in its own container.

**Colour coordination** - Each page is themed with its own colour to clarify the function of each page.

**Event Listing & Booking form** - Simple contact form to book a date time for a gig. Includes CSS styled event listing using bootstrap components.

## Testing
To ensure HTML standards are adhered to, the site URL was fed in to the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjulian-garcia.github.io%2Fthe-monkees%2Findex.html) and corrected accordingly to remove all errors. To test for site responsiveness, browser responsive mode was used to render the site simulating various screen widths. Tested across various browsers including: Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. Cross browser compatibility can be confirmed by visiting [browsershots.org](http://browsershots.org/https://julian-garcia.github.io/the-monkees/index.html) and feeding in the URL `https://julian-garcia.github.io/the-monkees/index.html`. Device wise, visual checks were performed on an Apple iPhone SE and Apple Macbook Pro.

## Deployment & Contributions
The site was deployed using the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) feature of Github which provides a server side address hosed by GitHub in order to render a static website. To contribute to this you'll need to do the following:
- create your own Github repository on GitHub
- create a local project directory on your PC, 
- navigate to that directory on the command line (for command line I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) on my mac), 
- clone this github repository by entering: `git clone https://github.com/julian-garcia/london-crime-trends.git`. 
Then use any text editor to make your changes to the CSS, HTML and/or content. To test, simply open index.html or the other html files locally in any web browser. Having finished development and testing:
- Navigate to your project directory on the command line and enter `git add .` 
- Enter `git commit -m 'My changes'` - replace 'my changes' with a brief overview of your changes
- Finally deploy using `git push -u origin master`
- To set up the static website, go to the settings of your github repository and select "master branch" from the source dropdown in the Github pages section
