## UX
Pre development wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) (see [wireframes.pdf](resources/wireframes.pdf)). Website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) was used to determine a colour
scheme that uses complementary colours (see [palette.pdf](resources/palette.pdf)).
***
## Features
**Album time line** - designed using custom CSS to complement bootstrap CSS.

**Image Gallery** - makes use of bootstrap modals, displaying each picture in its own container.

**Colour coordination** - Each page is themed with its own colour to clarify the function of each page.

**Event Listing & Booking form** - Simple contact form to book a date time for a gig. Includes CSS styled event listing using bootstrap components.

## Testing
To ensure HTML standards are adhered to, all html code was fed in to the W3C validator and corrected accordingly. To test for site responsiveness, browser responsive mode was used to render the site simulating various screen widths. Also tested directly on an Apple iPhone 5SE.

## Deployment
The site was deployed using the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) feature of Github which provides a server side address to render a front end based website.
